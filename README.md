# Identification-and-Semantic-Paraphrasing-of-Idioms-in-Hindi-
The identification of idioms is one of the challenges faced by most Natural Language Processing applications, specifically Machine Translation systems. Most existing systems fail to paraphrase the idioms while retaining their implicit meaning. Although research has commenced in multiple languages, there has not been as much research conducted in this domain for Hindi. With the aim of overcoming this drawback, for any given sentence in Hindi, the project seeks to identify if it contains an idiom, and if it does, replaces it with a sentence containing its implicit meaning, ensuring the resulting sentence is grammatically correct.
